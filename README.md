## Assignment
The goal of this exercise is to get a good idea of your experience of a variety of backend technologies, how your write code and approach the problem. Application import data from chat transcript api endpoint (JSON formatted). Executing the program or endpoint again should import the data without recreating the schema. 

#### Goal
1. Build application to import data JSON data into SQL database from endpoint (Data Transformation).
2. Create SQL query to do data analysis. (see Data Analysis section)

#### Data Analysis
Goal : Write one SQL query that will help us understand how many active customers and which page they came from
1. How many conversations have messages from customers and not agents grouped by
    - Which pages they came from (message_referer_url)
    - Conversation date
    - Conversation id


### Submission Guidelines

Submit by creating a message with a message or review to github user “slaveniq”

#### Please describe instruction in readme
1. Overview of your implementation
2. Requirements, how to install and execute your program
3. Use any backend technology you want.
